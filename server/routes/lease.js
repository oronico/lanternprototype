After conducting market research, I've found that similar properties in our area are leasing for $18-22 per square foot, while our current rate is $28 per square foot. Given the current market conditions and our successful tenancy, I would like to request a rent reduction to $3,000 per month.

This adjustment would:
- Align with current market rates
- Ensure our continued successful operation
- Maintain our excellent tenant relationship

I have attached market comparables for your review. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this request and explore mutually beneficial terms.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
