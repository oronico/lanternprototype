## **How Students Get Connected to Contracts - Step by Step**

### **Step 1: Family Inquiry**
```
New family contacts school
‚Üì
Enter in CRM:
- Family name

- Monthly tuition: $1,166 for 2 students

## **The Data Model Connection**

### **Family Record (CRM)**
```javascript
{
  familyId: "family_001",
  familyName: "Johnson",
  students: [
    { studentId: "student_001", name: "Emma Johnson", grade: "3rd" },
    { studentId: "student_002", name: "Liam Johnson", grade: "1st" }
  ],
  
  // THIS IS THE CONNECTION ‚Üì
  contractId: "contract_001",  // Links to contract
  
  paymentMethod: "ClassWallet",
  paymentSchedule: "monthly"
}
```

### **Contract Record**
```javascript
{
  contractId: "contract_001",
  
  // THIS IS THE CONNECTION ‚Üì
  familyId: "family_001",  // Links back to family
  
  studentIds: ["student_001", "student_002"],  // Links to specific students
  
  monthlyTuition: 1166,
  startDate: "2024-08-15",
  endDate: "2025-06-15",
  status: "signed"
}
```

### **Payment Transaction**
```javascript
{
  transactionId: "pay_001",
  amount: 1166,
  date: "2024-11-01",
  
  // THIS IS THE CONNECTION ‚Üì
  contractId: "contract_001",  // Links to contract
  familyId: "family_001",      // Links to family
  studentIds: ["student_001", "student_002"],  // Knows which students
  
  method: "ClassWallet",
  trancheId: "tranche_001",  // If from bulk payment
  status: "paid"
}
```

## **Real-World User Flow in Platform**

### **Scenario: Enroll Chen Family**

**1. User clicks "Add New Family" in CRM**
- Enter: Chen Family, David & Lisa Chen
- Add student: Michael Chen, 5th grade, ESA eligible
- Save

**2. User clicks "Generate Contract" for Chen Family**
- Platform auto-fills:
  - Family name: Chen Family
  - Student: Michael Chen, 5th grade
  - Tuition: $667/month (1 student)
  - ESA: $667 (fully covered)
- User reviews and clicks "Generate"

**3. User clicks "Send for Signature"**
- Email sent to David & Lisa Chen
- Contract includes Michael's name throughout
- Parents sign electronically

**4. User clicks "Link Payment" (after signatures)**
- Select payment method: ClassWallet (ESA)
- Platform creates link:
  ```
  Chen Family ‚Üí Contract_003 ‚Üí Michael Chen ‚Üí $667/month ClassWallet
  ```

## **Why This Connection Matters**

### **Without Proper Connection:**
‚ùå Payment comes in - who is it for?
‚ùå Student leaves - is their family paid up?
‚ùå Contract expires - which students renew?
‚ùå Manual work to figure out who owes what

### **With SchoolStack.ai Connection:**
‚úÖ Payment arrives ‚Üí instantly know which students
‚úÖ Student struggling ‚Üí see payment history + satisfaction score
‚úÖ Contract expiring ‚Üí automated re-enrollment for all students
‚úÖ Zero manual work - everything connected

## **The Missing Piece We Need to Build:**

### **Contract Generation Flow**
**Current:** Contract generator exists but not connected to CRM
**Need:** 
1. "Generate Contract" button in Family CRM
2. Auto-populate student names from family record
3. After signing, update family record with contractId
4. Link payment method to contract

**This workflow component will make the connection crystal clear!**

Would you like me to build the enrollment workflow component that visually shows users how to connect students ‚Üí contracts ‚Üí payments?
