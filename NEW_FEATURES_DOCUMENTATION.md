# SchoolStack.ai - New Features Documentation

## Overview

Based on feedback from school founders, we've built a comprehensive system that guides users through three different operational stages and provides behavioral nudges, milestone celebrations, and cash flow reality checks.

---

## 🚀 1. Three-Tier Onboarding System

### Component: `SchoolOnboarding.js`

**Purpose**: Personalized onboarding flow based on school's operational stage

### Three Operating Stages:

#### Year 0 - Pre-Launch
- **Features**: Fundraising tools, startup budget planning, enrollment projections
- **Focus**: Getting started, initial funding, first students
- **Milestones**: First 5 students, raise initial capital

#### Years 1-2 - Building
- **Features**: Growth modeling, cash flow management, basic analytics
- **Focus**: Stabilizing operations, reaching break-even
- **Milestones**: Break-even operations, target enrollment, 30-day cash reserve

#### Year 3+ - Scaling
- **Features**: Advanced forecasting, historical analysis, multi-year trends
- **Focus**: Optimization, expansion, financial independence
- **Milestones**: 60-90 day cash reserves, consistent profitability

### Data Collected:
- School name and fiscal year dates
- Current and target enrollment
- Financial system connections (QuickBooks, Xero, Gusto, etc.)
- Banking via Plaid integration
- Historical data uploads (P&Ls, cash flow, enrollment)
- Loan and debt information
- Current year proforma/budget
- Enrollment roster (CSV upload)

### Database Schema: `School.js`
```javascript
{
  operatingStage: 'year-0' | 'year-1-2' | 'year-3-plus',
  connections: { accounting, payroll, banking, creditCards },
  historicalData: [{ year, profitLoss, cashFlow, enrollment }],
  loans: [{ type, principal, monthlyPayment, interestRate }],
  proforma: { projectedRevenue, projectedExpenses, monthlyProjections }
}
```

## 💰 2. Cash Reality Dashboard

### Component: `CashRealityDashboard.js`

**Purpose**: Show the gap between budgeted expenses and actual cash availability

### Key Features:

#### Stoplight Health Indicator
- **Green (Healthy)**: 60+ days cash, all obligations covered
- **Blue (Good)**: 30-60 days cash, obligations covered
- **Yellow (Warning)**: 20-30 days cash or tight coverage
- **Orange (Urgent)**: 10-20 days cash, action needed
- **Red (Critical)**: <10 days cash, immediate action required

#### 30/60/90 Day View
Users can toggle between three time horizons to see:
- Current cash position
- Expected revenue
- Upcoming obligations (payroll, rent, utilities, loans, etc.)
- Projected ending cash

#### Scenario Planning Tool
Interactive "What-If" scenarios:
- Enrollment changes (+/- 20%)
- Expense adjustments (+/- 20%)
- Hiring delays (saves $3K/month)
- Real-time calculation of impact on cash position

#### Budget vs. Cash Reality Alert
When budgeted expenses exceed projected cash, shows:
- The gap amount
- Which expenses are at risk
- Recommended actions:
  1. Prioritize critical expenses (payroll, rent)
  2. Accelerate collections
  3. Time expenses strategically
  4. Consider short-term financing

---

## 📊 3. Budget vs. Cash Visualization

### Component: `BudgetVsCash.js`

**Purpose**: Help users understand the difference between what they planned to spend (budget) and what they can actually afford to pay (cash)

### Features:

#### Expense-by-Expense Analysis
Each budgeted line item shows:
- **Amount**: Dollar value of expense
- **Percentage**: Of total budget
- **Status**: Can afford now / Need to wait / At risk
- **Visual indicator**: Progress bar showing size relative to budget

#### Three Status Levels:
- ✓ **Covered**: Have cash today to pay this
- ⚠️ **Tight**: Need to wait for revenue before paying
- ❌ **At Risk**: Insufficient cash projected - consider deferring

#### Educational Component
Explains the critical concept:
> "Your budget shows what you plan to spend, but cash flow shows what you can actually afford to spend right now. Even if an expense is budgeted, you need to have the cash available to pay it when it's due."

#### Action Items
When cash is insufficient:
1. Prioritize expenses (payroll & rent first)
2. Accelerate collections
3. Time expenses strategically
4. Explore short-term options

## 🎯 8. Key Behavioral Design Principles

Inspired by Noom and behavioral psychology:

### 1. Daily Micro-Wins
Instead of quarterly reviews, users get:
- Daily check-ins with achievable tasks
- Small progress celebrations
- Consistent positive reinforcement

### 2. Positive Framing
Even difficult information is presented constructively:
- "Building toward 30 days cash" vs. "Only 22 days"
- "4 students away from target" vs. "Enrollment gap"
- "Opportunity to improve" vs. "Problem area"

### 3. Actionable Guidance
Every alert includes:
- Specific recommended actions
- One-click shortcuts
- Educational context
- Realistic timeframes

### 4. Celebration Culture
Major achievements trigger:
- Visual celebrations (confetti)
- Affirmative messages
- Progress acknowledgment
- Sharing opportunities

### 5. Empathetic Urgency
Critical issues are flagged but with empathy:
- Clear severity indicators
- Supportive language
- Realistic solutions
- Acknowledgment of difficulty
