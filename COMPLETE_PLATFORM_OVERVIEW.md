## 📊 Three Critical Operational Metrics (Now Live)

### **1. Contract Coverage**
**What It Shows**:
- Total families vs. families with signed contracts

**Why It Matters**:

- Revenue certainty
- Professional operations
- Required for loans/grants

**Location**: `/operations/metrics`

---

### **2. On-Time Payment Percentage**
**What It Shows**:
- Total payments vs. on-time payments
- On-time rate (Target: 90%+)
- Family distribution by payment quality:
  - Excellent (95%+ on-time) - 18 families
  - Good (85-94% on-time) - 6 families
  - Fair (70-84% on-time) - 3 families
  - Poor (<70% on-time) - 1 family
- Overdue payments requiring follow-up

**Why It Matters**:
- Cash flow predictability
- Identifies at-risk families early
- Enables proactive intervention
- Shows auto-pay opportunities

**Location**: `/operations/metrics`

---

### **3. Enrollment vs. Capacity (Utilization)**
**What It Shows**:
- Overall utilization percentage (Target: 85-95%)
- Per-program breakdown:
  - 5-Day Full-Time: 87.5% (14/16)
  - 3-Day Program: 66.7% (8/12)
  - After-School: 30.0% (6/20) ⚠️
  - Online: 48.0% (12/25)

## 🔧 Complex Scenarios Handled

### **Scenario 1: Sliding Scale Tuition**

**Example Setup**:
```javascript
Program: "5-Day Full-Time"
Sliding Scale Tiers:
- Tier 1: $0-50K income → $800/month
- Tier 2: $50-75K income → $1,000/month
- Tier 3: $75-100K income → $1,200/month
- Tier 4: $100K+ income → $1,400/month
```

**How It Works**:
1. Family provides income documentation
2. System auto-selects correct tier
3. Privacy protected (income encrypted)
4. Tuition calculated automatically
5. Metrics track actual revenue vs. potential

**Benefits**:
- Increases accessibility (lower-income families can afford)
- Maintains financial sustainability (higher-income families pay more)
- Automatic tier assignment
- Privacy protected

---

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Discounts Stacking**

**Example Family**: Staff member with 2 children

**Calculation**:
```
Child 1 (5-Day Program):
  Base Tuition: $1,200/month
  Staff Discount (50%): -$600
  Final: $600/month

Child 2 (3-Day Program):
  Base Tuition: $750/month
  Sibling Discount (15%): -$112.50
  Staff Discount (50%): -$375
  Max Discount Cap (50%): Applied
  Final: $375/month

Family Total: $975/month
Total Discounts: $975/month (50% savings)
```

**System Handles**:
- Multiple discount types
- Discount stacking rules
- Maximum discount caps
- Automatic calculation
- Transparent breakdown

---

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Program School**

**Example School**: 4 different programs

**Challenges**:
- Different capacity for each program
- Different pricing structures
- Different utilization rates
- Day-to-day variance in attendance

**How System Handles**:
```
Program 1: 5-Day Full-Time (16 capacity, 14 enrolled) = 87.5% utilized ✓
Program 2: 3-Day Part-Time (12 capacity, 8 enrolled) = 66.7% utilized ⚠️
Program 3: After-School (20 capacity, 6 enrolled) = 30.0% utilized ❌
Program 4: Online (25 capacity, 12 enrolled) = 48.0% utilized ⚠️

Overall Utilization: 54.8% (40/73)
Available Revenue Opportunity: $26,850/month if fully utilized
```

**Insights Generated**:
- "After-School program at 30% - marketing opportunity"
- "3-Day program trending down - consider pricing adjustment"
- "5-Day program near capacity - prepare waitlist management"

---
