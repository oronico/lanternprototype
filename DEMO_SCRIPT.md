## 🎬 The Demo Script

### **INTRO** (30 seconds)

**SAY**:
> "Thanks for taking time to chat! I'm building SchoolStack.ai because I kept hearing from microschool founders that financial management is overwhelming. Let me show you what we've built—I'd love your honest feedback."

**ACTION**: Share screen, show pricing page

---

### **HOOK: The Money Pitch** (1 minute)

**SAY**:
> "Quick question: What are you currently paying for bookkeeping?"

**WAIT** for answer. Common responses:
- "$2,500/month"
- "I do it myself, takes 10-20 hours/month"
- "We can't afford a bookkeeper yet"

**THEN SAY**:
> "So here's what we're doing: We're replacing that $2,500/month bookkeeper with AI-powered automation for $99/month."

**POINT TO SCREEN** (pricing page):
> "You can see the breakdown here—Professional plan at $99 gives you full automated bookkeeping, bank-ready reports, and a Chief of Staff dashboard. You'd save $2,400 a month, or about $29,000 a year."

**PAUSE** - Let that sink in.

**SAY**:
> "Let me show you how it actually works..."

---

### **DEMO PART 1: The Pain → The Solution** (3 minutes)

#### **Navigate to**: `/operations/metrics`

**SAY**:
> "Every school founder I talk to struggles with three things. Let me show you how we solve them."

#### **Point 1: Contract Coverage**

**POINT TO** Contract Coverage card (85.7%)

**SAY**:
> "First, contracts. You need to know which families have actually signed agreements. This shows you 24 of 28 families signed—that's 85.7% coverage. The 4 families who haven't signed are listed right here with specific actions: 'Martinez Family - sent 10 days ago, not signed.' One click to send a reminder."

**PAUSE**

> "Banks and insurance companies want to see this at 95%+. Now you always know where you stand."

#### **Point 2: On-Time Payments**

**POINT TO** On-Time Payment card (82.1%)

**SAY**:
> "Second, cash flow. This shows 82.1% of your families pay on time. But look—we break it down by family quality: 18 families are excellent payers, 6 are good, 3 are fair, and 1 is poor."

**PAUSE**

> "We automatically flag the families who are late—'Johnson Family, 15 days late, $1,166'—so you know exactly who to follow up with. No more spreadsheets."

#### **Point 3: Utilization**

**SCROLL DOWN** to Utilization by Program

**SAY**:
> "Third, enrollment. Most schools have multiple programs—3-day, 5-day, after-school, online. This shows you're at 54.8% overall utilization, but look—your After-School program is only at 30%. That's a $3,000-5,000/month revenue opportunity if you fill those spots."

**PAUSE**

> "The system literally tells you where to focus your marketing."

---

### **DEMO PART 2: The Secret Weapon - Payment Attribution** (2 minutes)

#### **Navigate to**: `/payments/reconciliation`

**SAY**:
> "Now, here's where it gets really powerful. You probably take payments through Stripe, ClassWallet, maybe Omella, right?"

**WAIT** for confirmation

**SAY**:
> "Here's the problem: ClassWallet batches payments weekly. You get one $8,745 transfer that's actually 15 different families. And you've got families with 2 kids paying $1,749 that needs to be split into $1,166 and $583."

**POINT TO** the batch payment row

**SAY**:
> "Our AI automatically matches batch transfers to individual students. See this Martinez Family payment? $1,749 for two kids. AI split it: Sofia gets $1,166, Lucas gets $583. 99% confidence. One click to approve, and it syncs to QuickBooks."

**CLICK** "Review & Allocate" on any needs-review payment

**SHOW** modal:
> "If the AI isn't sure—like this partial payment—it flags it for you. AI suggests how to allocate it, you can adjust if needed, click approve, and it's done."

**CLOSE** modal

**SAY**:
> "This saves hours every month. No more manual spreadsheet matching."

---

### **DEMO PART 3: Bank-Ready Reports** (2 minutes)

#### **Navigate to**: `/reports/bank-ready`

**SAY**:
> "So here's the other big pain point: Banks want professional financial statements. Most bookkeepers charge $200-500 per loan application package."

**POINT TO** SBA Loan Application Package

**SAY**:
> "We give you bank-ready reports with one click. SBA loan package includes everything: 3-year P&L, balance sheet, cash flow statement, debt schedule—formatted exactly how banks expect."

**SCROLL DOWN** to trust section

**SAY**:
> "These are GAAP compliant, follow double-entry bookkeeping, and are in the bank-approved format. We've had schools get approved for $50K to $2M in loans using these reports."

**PAUSE**

> "And it's instant. Click, download, submit to your bank."

---

### **DEMO PART 4: The Chief of Staff** (1 minute)

#### **Navigate to**: `/back-office`

**SAY**:
> "Last thing: Managing a school is lonely. You're the founder, director, teacher, marketer, AND bookkeeper. So we built you a Chief of Staff."

**POINT TO** dashboard sections:

**SAY**:
> "Every day you log in, it shows you exactly what needs attention:
> - Your tasks for the day with time estimates
> - Which documents are expiring (workers comp in 46 days!)
> - Your bookkeeping status
> - Cash position
> 
> It's like having an operations manager who keeps you organized."

---

### **DEMO PART 5: The "Wow" Moment - Milestones** (1 minute) 🎊

#### **Navigate to**: `/milestones`

**SAY**:
> "One more thing—and this is kind of fun. Managing cash is stressful, right? So we gamified it."

**POINT TO** milestones with progress bars

**SAY**:
> "You set goals—30 days cash reserve, target enrollment, 95% collection rate—and we track your progress. When you achieve a milestone..."

**CLICK** "Celebrate (Demo)" button

**WAIT** for confetti! 🎊

**SAY** (while confetti is falling):
> "You get confetti! 🎉 I know it seems silly, but this is based on behavioral psychology from apps like Noom. Celebrating small wins makes the hard work sustainable."

**PAUSE**

> "Managing a school's finances is overwhelming. We're trying to make it less lonely."

---

### **CLOSE: The Ask** (1 minute)

**Navigate back to**: `/pricing`

**SAY**:
> "So that's SchoolStack.ai. To summarize:
> - $99/month instead of $2,500 for a bookkeeper
> - Automated transaction categorization
> - Bank-ready reports for loans and grants
> - Payment attribution across Stripe, ClassWallet, Omella
> - Document repository with compliance tracking
> - Daily guidance on what needs attention
> 
> We're replacing your bookkeeper AND giving you tools no bookkeeper could provide."

**PAUSE**

**ASK**:
> "Honest feedback: If this worked as I showed, would you use it? Would you cancel your bookkeeper?"

**LISTEN** carefully to objections/concerns

---

## 💬 Handling Common Objections

### **Objection 1**: "My bookkeeper knows my business"

**RESPONSE**:
> "That's valuable! Here's what we recommend: Keep your bookkeeper but reduce their hours from 20 to 5 per month. We do 75% of the work (categorization, reconciliation), they review and handle the edge cases. You save $1,500/month and keep that relationship."

---

### **Objection 2**: "Will my CPA accept this?"

**RESPONSE**:
> "Great question. We sync everything to QuickBooks Online or Xero—your CPA logs in like always. They see perfectly maintained books. In fact, we've had CPAs tell us this is cleaner than what they usually see because the AI is consistent."

**SHOW**: QuickBooks sync status in bookkeeping dashboard

---

### **Objection 3**: "What about my specific situation [complex discounts/schedules]?"

**NAVIGATE TO**: `/programs`

**SHOW** Program Management:
> "We built this to handle any scenario. Sliding scale tuition? Check. Sibling discounts? Check. Staff discounts? Check. Multiple programs with different schedules? Check. It's all configurable."

---

### **Objection 4**: "I need reports for [specific grant/loan type]"

**NAVIGATE TO**: `/reports/bank-ready`

**SAY**:
> "We have templates for SBA loans, lines of credit, foundation grants, investor due diligence, and board packages. If you need something custom, our Enterprise plan includes a dedicated success manager who'll build exactly what you need."

---

### **Objection 5**: "This seems too cheap to be good"

**RESPONSE**:
> "I get it. Here's the thing: Bookkeepers charge $2,500 because it's labor-intensive. They're manually categorizing 100+ transactions every month. Our AI does that in 3 seconds. We can serve 100 schools with the same cost structure a bookkeeper uses for 1 school. That's why we can charge $99."

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Demo Best Practices**:

1. **Ask questions first**
   - "What's your biggest pain point?"
   - "How much time do you spend on finances?"
   - Tailor demo to their needs

2. **Use their data**
   - "How many students do you have?"
   - Update the student count on pricing page
   - Show ROI specific to them

3. **Tell stories**
   - "I talked to a founder who spent 15 hours/month on bookkeeping..."
   - Makes it relatable

4. **Handle silence**
   - After showing price savings, pause
   - Let them process
   - Silence is good—they're thinking

5. **End with action**
   - Always have a clear next step
   - Beta access, follow-up call, trial signup

### **What NOT to Do**:

❌ Don't explain every feature (boring)  
❌ Don't use jargon ("GAAP", "double-entry") unless they ask  
❌ Don't bash competitors (QuickBooks, bookkeepers)  
❌ Don't oversell—let the product speak  
❌ Don't forget to ask for the sale!
