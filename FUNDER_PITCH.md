## **The Problem - $500M Market Opportunity**

### **Education businesses are failing financially - but not academically**

**The Core Issue:**
- Collect tuition 9 months (Aug-May)
- Pay expenses 12 months (year-round)
- **Summer gap kills schools** - need $30K+ reserves

**Current "Solution":**
- Hire bookkeeper: $30K-50K/year
- Get generic accounting (doesn't understand enrollment dynamics)
- No strategic guidance on enrollment = revenue
- Multiple disconnected systems (payments, contracts, students)

**Market Pain:**
- 3,000+ microschools struggling with cash flow
- 70% don't make it past year 3
- Average owner takes $0 salary year 1-2
- Lose 2 students = lose profit margin (enrollment is EVERYTHING)
