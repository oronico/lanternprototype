# Operational Metrics System - SchoolStack.ai

## üéØ Based on Real School Founder Feedback

Schools need to track **three critical operational metrics**:

1. **Contract Coverage** - % of families with signed agreements
2. **On-Time Payment Percentage** - Payment behavior tracking  
3. **Enrollment vs. Capacity** - Utilization rate by program

Plus handle complex scenarios:
- Sliding scale tuition (income-based)
- Staff discounts
- Sibling discounts
- Multiple programs (3-day, 5-day, online, after-school)
- Program-specific enrollment tracking
- Day-to-day utilization variance

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Model Design

### **Program Model** (`server/models/Program.js`)

Flexible enough to handle thousands of schools with different configurations:

**Key Features**:
```javascript
{
  // Program Types
  type: 'full-time' | 'part-time' | 'drop-in' | 'online' | 'hybrid' | 'after-school' | 'summer',
  
  // Schedule Flexibility
  scheduleType: 'days-per-week' | 'specific-days' | 'flexible' | 'sessions',
  daysPerWeek: 3 | 5,  // For "3-day program", "5-day program"
  specificSchedule: [{ dayOfWeek, startTime, endTime, capacity }],
  
  // Capacity Management
  totalCapacity: 16,
  currentEnrollment: 14,
  waitlistCount: 2,
  
  // Per-Day Capacity (for varying daily attendance)
  dailyCapacity: [
    { dayOfWeek: 'Monday', capacity: 20, currentEnrollment: 18 },
    { dayOfWeek: 'Tuesday', capacity: 20, currentEnrollment: 15 }
  ],
  
  // Sliding Scale Pricing
  hasSlidingScale: true,
  slidingScaleTiers: [
    { name: 'Tier 1: $0-50K', pricePerMonth: 800, incomeMin: 0, incomeMax: 50000 },
    { name: 'Tier 2: $50-75K', pricePerMonth: 1000, incomeMin: 50000, incomeMax: 75000 },
    { name: 'Tier 3: $75-100K', pricePerMonth: 1200, incomeMin: 75000, incomeMax: 100000 },
    { name: 'Tier 4: $100K+', pricePerMonth: 1400, incomeMin: 100000, incomeMax: null }
  ],
  
  // Discount Rules
  discountRules: [
    {
      type: 'sibling',
      name: 'Second Child Discount',
      discountType: 'percentage',
      discountValue: 15,
      appliesTo: 'second-child',
      canStackWithOther: true,
      maxDiscountPercent: 50
    },
    {
      type: 'staff',
      name: 'Staff Family Discount',
      discountType: 'percentage',
      discountValue: 50,
      canStackWithOther: false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Smart Methods**:
```javascript
// Automatically calculate tuition with all discounts
program.calculateTuition(familyIncome, studentCount, hasStaffDiscount);

// Returns:
{
  baseTuition: 1000,
  totalDiscount: 150,
  finalTuition: 850,
  discountsApplied: [
    { type: 'sibling', child: 2, amount: 150 }
  ]
}

// Update enrollment count automatically
program.updateEnrollment();
```

### **Enrollment Model** (`server/models/Enrollment.js`)

Tracks individual student enrollments with detailed metrics:

**Key Features**:
```javascript
{
  // Student & Family Links
  studentId: ObjectId,
  familyId: ObjectId,
  programId: ObjectId,
  
  // Status Tracking
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'withdrawn' | 'graduated' | 'waitlist',
  
  // CONTRACT COVERAGE TRACKING
  contractStatus: 'not-sent' | 'sent' | 'viewed' | 'signed' | 'expired' | 'declined',
  contractSentDate: Date,
  contractSignedDate: Date,
  contractExpiryDate: Date,
  
  // Pricing with Discounts Applied
  baseTuition: 1200,
  discountsApplied: [
    { type: 'sibling', name: '2nd Child Discount', amount: 180, percentage: 15 },
    { type: 'staff', name: 'Staff Discount', amount: 600, percentage: 50 }
  ],
  totalDiscount: 780,
  monthlyTuition: 420,
  
  // ON-TIME PAYMENT TRACKING
  onTimePayments: 8,
  latePayments: 2,
  missedPayments: 0,
  averageDaysLate: 4.5,
  
  paymentStatus: 'current' | 'late' | 'delinquent' | 'paid-in-full',
  lastPaymentDate: Date,
  nextPaymentDue: Date,
  
  // Payment Behavior Score (0-100)
  paymentScore: 85  // Calculated virtual field
}
```

**Smart Methods**:
```javascript
// Record a payment and auto-update metrics
enrollment.recordPayment(amount, date);

// Update contract status
enrollment.updateContractStatus('signed', date);
```

### **Family Model** (`server/models/Family.js`)

Household-level tracking for multi-student families:

**Key Features**:
```javascript
{
  // Household Information
  householdIncome: 65000,  // Encrypted in production
  incomeVerified: true,
  
  // Staff Status
  isStaffFamily: true,
  staffMember: { name: 'Jane Smith', role: 'Teacher', startDate: Date },
  
  // Aggregate Metrics
  studentCount: 2,
  totalMonthlyTuition: 1620,
  totalDiscounts: 380,
  
  // Payment Behavior (Aggregated from all enrollments)
  paymentScore: 92,
  onTimePaymentRate: 90.5,
  totalOnTimePayments: 16,
  totalLatePayments: 2,
  currentBalance: 0,
  
  // CONTRACT COVERAGE (Aggregated)
  allContractsSigned: true,
  contractsSignedCount: 2,
  contractsPendingCount: 0
}
```

**Smart Methods**:
```javascript
// Auto-calculate all family metrics from enrollments
family.calculatePaymentMetrics();
```

## üí° Key Differentiators

### **Why This System Scales**:

1. **Flexible Program Model**
   - Supports any schedule type (3-day, 5-day, specific days, flexible)
   - Handles capacity at program and per-day level
   - Works for 1 program or 50 programs

2. **Sophisticated Discount Engine**
   - Multiple discount types can stack
   - Max discount caps prevent over-discounting
   - Works for siblings, staff, scholarships, custom
   - Automatically calculates final tuition

3. **Sliding Scale Without Complexity**
   - Income tiers configured per program
   - Auto-selects correct tier based on family income
   - Protects privacy (income encrypted)

4. **Real-Time Metrics**
   - Enrollments auto-update program counts
   - Family metrics aggregate from all children
   - Payment behavior tracked per transaction
   - Contract status always current

5. **Actionable Insights**
   - Not just metrics, but "what to do about it"
   - Identifies which families need attention
   - Shows revenue opportunity from underutilized programs
   - Prioritizes actions by urgency

---

## üîÑ How It Works in Practice

### **Scenario 1: New Family Enrolls Two Children**

```javascript
// 1. Create Family
const family = new Family({
  schoolId,
  primaryContactName: 'Sarah Martinez',
  primaryContactEmail: 'sarah@email.com',
  householdIncome: 65000,
  isStaffFamily: false,
  studentCount: 2
});

// 2. Enroll First Child (5-Day Program)
const program = await Program.findById(fiveDayProgramId);
const tuition1 = program.calculateTuition(65000, 1, false);
// Returns: { baseTuition: 1000, totalDiscount: 0, finalTuition: 1000 }

const enrollment1 = new Enrollment({
  schoolId,
  studentId: child1Id,
  familyId: family._id,
  programId: program._id,
  baseTuition: tuition1.baseTuition,
  totalDiscount: tuition1.totalDiscount,
  monthlyTuition: tuition1.finalTuition,
  contractStatus: 'not-sent',
  status: 'pending'
});

// 3. Enroll Second Child (3-Day Program) - Gets Sibling Discount!
const program2 = await Program.findById(threeDayProgramId);
const tuition2 = program2.calculateTuition(65000, 2, false);
// Returns: { baseTuition: 650, totalDiscount: 97.50, finalTuition: 552.50 }
// (Applied 15% sibling discount)

const enrollment2 = new Enrollment({
  schoolId,
  studentId: child2Id,
  familyId: family._id,
  programId: program2._id,
  baseTuition: tuition2.baseTuition,
  totalDiscount: tuition2.totalDiscount,
  monthlyTuition: tuition2.finalTuition,
  discountsApplied: tuition2.discountsApplied,
  contractStatus: 'not-sent',
  status: 'pending'
});

// 4. Update Metrics
await program.updateEnrollment();     // 5-Day: 14 ‚Üí 15 enrolled
await program2.updateEnrollment();    // 3-Day: 8 ‚Üí 9 enrolled
await family.calculatePaymentMetrics(); // Family total: $1,552.50/mo

// 5. Metrics Dashboard Now Shows:
// - Contract Coverage: 85.7% ‚Üí 83.3% (2 new unsigned contracts)
// - 5-Day Utilization: 87.5% ‚Üí 93.8% (closer to capacity!)
// - 3-Day Utilization: 66.7% ‚Üí 75.0% (improving!)
```

### **Scenario 2: Family Makes Late Payment**

```javascript
// Payment received 5 days late
enrollment.recordPayment(1000, new Date());

// Auto-updates:
// - onTimePayments: stays same
// - latePayments: +1
// - averageDaysLate: calculated
// - paymentScore: reduced (was 100 ‚Üí now 95)
// - family.paymentScore: recalculated
// - family.onTimePaymentRate: updated

// Metrics Dashboard Now Shows:
// - On-Time Payment %: 82.1% ‚Üí 81.9% (slightly worse)
// - Family moves from "Excellent" to "Good" payment quality bucket
```

### **Scenario 3: Contract Gets Signed**

```javascript
enrollment.updateContractStatus('signed', new Date());

// Auto-updates:
// - contractStatus: 'not-sent' ‚Üí 'signed'
// - contractSignedDate: today
// - family.contractsSignedCount: +1
// - family.contractsPendingCount: -1
// - family.allContractsSigned: true (if all done)

// Metrics Dashboard Now Shows:
// - Contract Coverage: 83.3% ‚Üí 85.7% (back up!)
// - One less urgent action
```
