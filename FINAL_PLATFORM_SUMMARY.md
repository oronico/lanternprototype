## 🎯 **Strategic Intelligence Built In**

### Enrollment + Attendance = Cash Flow

**The platform understands this relationship:**

```
Enrollment ──────┐
                 ├─→ Daily Attendance ─→ Revenue Recognition ─→ Cash Flow
Payment Method ──┘

If attendance drops → Revenue at risk
If enrollment drops → Immediate cash crisis
If payments late → Cash flow problem

Platform monitors ALL THREE constantly
```

### Command Center Shows Urgency:

**Enrollment Nudges:**
- 🚨 URGENT: Only 22/35 enrolled (63% capacity) → Revenue gap!
- 💡 ACTION: 5 families in recruitment pipeline → Convert now!
- 🎯 GOAL: Need 13 more students for full enrollment

**Attendance Nudges:**
- ⚠️ URGENT: Ethan 2 absences → Call family today
- 📉 WARNING: Attendance 94% this week (below 95% goal)
- 🔥 POSITIVE: 12-day streak taking attendance!

**Cash Flow Nudges:**
- 🚨 URGENT: Days cash dropped to 18 (below 20)
- 💰 POSITIVE: Cash improved +4 days this week!
- 🎯 GOAL: Build to 30 days for stability

**Document Nudges:**
- 📝 URGENT: 3 students missing contracts → Send today
- ⏰ WARNING: Insurance renewal in 15 days
- ✅ POSITIVE: All handbooks signed!

**Tone:** Urgent but warm, strategic but encouraging

## 💡 **Strategic Metrics (Paranoid but Encouraging)**

### Enrollment Health Score:
```
Current: 28/35 students (80%)
Message: "Great progress! Just 7 more students for full enrollment 🎯"
Urgency: Medium (not critical but important)
Action: "View recruitment pipeline - 5 families in process!"
```

### Attendance Rate:
```
Current: 98%
Message: "Excellent! You've exceeded your 95% goal! ⭐"
Urgency: None (celebrating success)
Action: "Keep up the great work!"
```

### Cash Flow Driver:
```
Enrollment × Attendance × Payment Rate = Actual Revenue

Example:
35 students × $1,200/mo × 100% attendance × 98% payment = $41,160
28 students × $1,200/mo × 98% attendance × 100% payment = $32,928

Missing 7 students = $8,232/mo revenue gap!
```

**Platform shows this relationship clearly**
