## ❓ **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

**Q: Can this really replace a bookkeeper?**  
A: It reduces bookkeeper from $2,500/mo to $500/mo today. With Phase 2 features (smart categorization, month-end automation), we get to 95% replacement for most schools.

**Q: What about the ClassWallet problem?**  
A: [Demo it live] Weekly tranche deposits auto-split to students, one-click sync to QuickBooks. Saves 10+ hours/month.

**Q: Why will schools switch from their current tools?**  
A: They're using spreadsheets and 5-10 disconnected tools. We're ONE platform that actually understands their business. Plus we save them $24k/year on bookkeeper costs.

**Q: What's your competitive moat?**  
A: Domain expertise. We understand ESA/vouchers, microschool operations, sliding scale tuition. Enterprise tools don't. We're built specifically for this market.

**Q: How do you acquire customers?**  
A: Content marketing in microschool communities (Facebook groups, conferences), partnerships with ClassWallet/Omella, referrals. Very targeted, low CAC.

**Q: What's the roadmap?**  
A: Phase 1: Mobile teacher access, smart categorization. Phase 2: AI features (agenda builder, receipt OCR). Phase 3: Parent portal, marketplace.
