## 🚨 Known Limitations (Mock Data)

Currently using mock data for:
- Bank account connections (no real Plaid yet)
- Transaction categorization (simulated AI)
- QuickBooks sync status (not connected)
- Document uploads (frontend only)
- Nudge generation (static examples)

**These work perfectly for demos** but will need real API connections for production use.
